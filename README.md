# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Projects

This repository includes two Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models:
1. **Vanilla RAG Implementation** - A foundational RAG model for basic retrieval and generation tasks.
2. **RAG with UI** - An enhanced RAG model with a user-friendly interface for interactive querying and response generation.

## Project Overview

### 1. Vanilla RAG Implementation
The vanilla RAG implementation demonstrates setting up a basic RAG model, which combines retrieval and generation mechanisms. This notebook provides steps for:
   - Initializing a retrieval mechanism.
   - Integrating it with a generative model.
   - Running queries and generating responses based on the retrieved context.

### 2. RAG with UI
This project builds on the vanilla RAG model by incorporating a user interface to facilitate easier interaction with the model. Using Streamlit, the notebook provides an interactive frontend where users can enter queries, view retrieved documents, and receive generated responses, making it suitable for scenarios requiring quick, user-friendly feedback.

## Requirements

Both projects rely on similar dependencies. Make sure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Streamlit (for the RAG with UI notebook)
- Faiss (or an alternative retrieval library)
- Any additional libraries as specified in each notebook.

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
